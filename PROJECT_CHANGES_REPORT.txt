WHAT IS A DRAWING EVENT?

A Drawing Event is a lottery-style feature where:
- A user creates a drawing event and invites other users
- Each invited user receives an invitation to participate
- Users can accept or decline the invitation
- Once all participants accept, the drawing can be executed
- The system randomly assigns each participant to another participant
- Each participant then needs to buy a gift for their assigned person
